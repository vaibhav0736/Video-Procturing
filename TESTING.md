# Video Proctoring System - Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions for the video proctoring system after implementing critical bug fixes.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Session Ending Error ✅
**Problem**: Backend was throwing errors when ending sessions
**Solution**: 
- Added proper session ID validation (MongoDB ObjectId format)
- Added check for already completed sessions
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages
- Added proper cleanup in frontend component

### 2. AI Models Loaded Event Spam ✅
**Problem**: "AI models loaded successfully" was being logged repeatedly
**Solution**:
- Added condition to only log this event once when models are first loaded
- Implemented duplicate event filtering in backend bulk events endpoint
- Added proper dependency tracking in useCallback

### 3. Backend Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Various backend endpoints lacked proper error handling
**Solution**:
- Added input validation for all endpoints
- Improved error messages and status codes
- Added duplicate event prevention
- Enhanced session management with proper state checks

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure MongoDB Atlas connection is configured in backend/.env
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd video-proctoring-system
   npm install
   
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

### Backend Testing

1. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   Expected: Server starts on port 5000 with MongoDB connection

2. **Test Health Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```
   Expected: Returns success response with timestamp

3. **Test Session Creation**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/sessions \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
     "candidateName": "Test User",
     "candidateEmail": "test@example.com",
     "interviewTitle": "Test Interview"
   }'
   ```
   Expected: Returns session object with ID

4. **Test Session Ending**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/sessions/{SESSION_ID}/end \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"videoRecorded": true}'
   ```
   Expected: Returns success message without errors

### Frontend Testing

1. **Start Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Expected: Vite dev server starts on port 5173

2. **Test Candidate Form**
   - Fill out candidate information
   - Click "Start Proctoring Session"
   - Expected: Form validates and transitions to video interface

3. **Test Video Proctoring**
   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Expected: Video feed appears with AI model loading message (only once)
   - Expected: Face detection overlay appears
   - Expected: Event log shows system initialization events

4. **Test AI Detection**
   - Look away from camera for >5 seconds
   - Expected: "Looking away" violation logged
   - Cover camera or move away for >10 seconds
   - Expected: "No face detected" violation logged
   - Have multiple people in frame
   - Expected: "Multiple faces detected" violation logged

5. **Test Session Management**
   - Start session and verify backend connection
   - Generate some events by looking away
   - Click "End Session"
   - Expected: Session ends without errors, events are synced

6. **Test Report Generation**
   - After ending session, click "View Report"
   - Expected: Report modal opens with session details and integrity score
   - Click "Download Report"
   - Expected: JSON file downloads with complete session data

### Error Scenarios to Test

1. **Backend Offline**
   - Stop backend server
   - Start frontend session
   - Expected: "Backend unavailable - running in offline mode" message

2. **Invalid Session ID**
   - Try to end session with malformed ID
   - Expected: Proper error message, no crashes

3. **Duplicate Events**
   - Rapid event generation
   - Expected: No duplicate events in backend, smooth performance

## Performance Testing

1. **Event Sync Performance**
   - Generate many events quickly (look away repeatedly)
   - Expected: Events batched and synced every 5 seconds without lag

2. **Video Recording**
   - Start recording and run session for 2-3 minutes
   - End session and download video
   - Expected: Video file downloads successfully with clear quality

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Run session for extended period
   - Expected: No memory leaks, stable performance

## Security Testing

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Make rapid API requests
   - Expected: Rate limiting kicks in after 100 requests per 15 minutes

2. **CORS**
   - Try accessing API from different origin
   - Expected: CORS policy blocks unauthorized origins

3. **Input Validation**
   - Send malformed data to API endpoints
   - Expected: Proper validation errors, no crashes

## Expected Results After Fixes

✅ No more "Failed to end session properly" errors
✅ "AI models loaded successfully" appears only once
✅ Smooth event synchronization without duplicates
✅ Proper error handling throughout the system
✅ Clean session lifecycle management
✅ Stable video recording and download
✅ Accurate integrity scoring and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera Access Denied**
   - Solution: Enable camera permissions in browser settings

2. **Backend Connection Failed**
   - Check MongoDB Atlas connection string in .env
   - Verify backend server is running on correct port

3. **AI Models Loading Slowly**
   - Normal on first load, models are cached after initial download
   - Ensure stable internet connection for model downloads

4. **Video Recording Not Working**
   - Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
   - Ensure sufficient disk space for video files

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true')
```

This will show additional console logs for troubleshooting.

## Next Steps

After successful testing:
1. Deploy backend to production environment
2. Configure production MongoDB database
3. Set up frontend deployment with proper build configuration
4. Implement monitoring and logging for production use
5. Add user authentication and session management
6. Implement advanced AI features (emotion detection, behavior analysis)
